1. Relational database (mysql) without ORM
As soon I started writing the code I faced the problem of having to first create the database
with all of tables and correct relations between then. And even though this is a simple
example I still don't like that I will spend more time writing SQL than actual code.

A lot of time was spent on creating custom template SQL statements for each object and for each necessary CRUD command.

TLDR: I would prefer to use an ORM to take care of all the table creation, so that I didn't have
to think about sql and could concentrate on coding.
